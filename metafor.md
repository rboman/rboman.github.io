# Metafor

Metafor is an implicit simulation code written in C++ and python for the modelling of forming processes using the finite element method. 

Metafor is able to handle:
- large deformations/rotations,
- non-linear constitutive behaviours of materials,
- contact with rigid/deformable tools or self contact.

Typical applications are:
- metal forming such as roll forming, deep drawing, levelling, extrusion, etc.
- crash/impact (onto metals or composites)
- biomechanics,
- fluid / structure coupling (with the help of [CUPyDO](https://github.com/ulgltas/CUPyDO)).

Metafor was initially the result of the PhD thesis of Prof. [Jean-Philippe PONTHOT](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dwFpwXYAAAAJ&hl=en) , my PhD supervisor. 
In 2000, I decided to entirely rewrite Metafor using C++ with the help my colleagues and the Oofelie toolkit (see [Open Engineering](https://www.open-engineering.com/)).

Now, Metafor is a set of 33 libraries totalling 1400 C++ classes (more than 230k lines of code). The test suite contains more than 3100 finite element models that are verified before each commit.
